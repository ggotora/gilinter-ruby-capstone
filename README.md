# Gilinter - A Microverse Ruby Capstone Project
> In this project, Ibuild my own linter that will make life easier for a developer

> I decided to implement a JavaScript Linter that utilises JavaScript Best Practices as documented on w3schools website https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_best_practices.asp


# Project Specifications
