# Gilinter - A Microverse Ruby Capstone Project
> In this project, I was required to build my own linter that can make life easier for a developer

> I decided to implement a JavaScript Linter that utilises JavaScript Best Practices documented on w3schools website https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_best_practices.asp


# Project Specifications
- A linter developed in Ruby
- It's a linter for beginners, i.e., it provides feedback about errors or warning in code little by little
- You choose the rest of the functionality for the linter
# How to run the tests
- Download or clone the repository's files github repo
- Have Ruby 2.7 installed (to check if it is installed you can run: ruby -version in your console)
- Once repo is downloaded to local directory, in you console run cmd: ruby ./bin/main.rb
